# adventofcode2021
This repo contains my solutions to all of the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) riddles from 2021.

Every branch contains the code for the specific riddle. Since there are 2 riddles a day, there are two branches per day named with `*_1` and `*_2`.

## How to compile

All programs are written in C++ and can be built using CMake. Therefore, to make an out-of-source build, enter
``` bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
